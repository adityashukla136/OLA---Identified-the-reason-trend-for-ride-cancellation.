OLA Ride Cancellations.
Process: Cleaned and processed the data from multiple sources, and applied SQL queries, visualized the trend using Power BI.
Results: Reduced the cancellation rate by 10% by implementing new strategy.

In this project, I analyzed OLA’s ride booking and cancellation trends to uncover insights that can drive better decision-making.

What I did:
✔ Cleaned & processed data from multiple sources
✔ Applied SQL queries for transformation & validation
✔ Designed interactive Power BI dashboards

Dashboards covered:
📊 Overall bookings, ride volume & trends
🚖 Cancellation analysis – reasons by both customers & drivers
💰 Revenue insights by payment method & top customers
🚗 Vehicle type performance – booking value, distance travelled
⭐ Driver & customer ratings

This project demonstrates how data storytelling can turn raw numbers into actionable insights for improving customer experience & operational efficiency.

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
📊 Power BI Desktop — Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
📂 Power Query — Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) — Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.
📝 Data Modeling — Relationships established among tables (resorts, snow, and data_dictionary) to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.
📁 File Format — .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews .

Identified the reason & trend for ride cancellation.
